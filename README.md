# Grocery Grab Application

## Description

Grocery Grab is an app that allows the user to create lists and have them texted to their phone. Although the idea behind the lists was to be for groceries, the app allows for any kind of list. Creating an account and logging in allows the user to save their lists so that they are there whenever they log in.
